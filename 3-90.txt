<b>concatMap</b>
The concatMap operator in RxJS is used to map each value emitted by an observable into a new observable, and then flatten the result in a sequential manner. This means that it processes each inner observable one after the other, waiting for the previous one to complete before subscribing to the next.

<i>Syntax:</i>
concatMap(project: (value, index) => Observable, resultSelector?: (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) => value): observable
project:
A function that takes two arguments:
value: The value emitted by the source observable.
index: The index of the value in the source observable.
resultSelector (optional):
A function that takes four arguments:
outerValue: The value emitted by the source observable.
innerValue: The value emitted by the inner observable returned by the project function.
outerIndex: The index of the value from the source observable.
innerIndex: The index of the value from the inner observable.
