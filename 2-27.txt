<b>last</b>
The last() operator in RxJS is used to retrieve the last emitted value from an observable before it completes. It allows you to specify a condition, and it will emit the last value that meets that condition when the observable completes. If the observable completes without emitting any values, last() will throw an error unless a default value is provided.
We will discuss the condition and errors in future classes.

In our project, we want to have the last suggested stock displayed separately, to do so, we will use the last() operator.
