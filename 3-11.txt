<b>behaviorSubject</b>
In RxJS, the BehaviorSubject is a special kind of Subject that requires an initial value and emits its current value to new subscribers immediately upon subscription.
A BehaviorSubject always holds the latest value that it has emitted. When a new subscriber joins, it will immediately receive the last emitted value, even if it was emitted before the subscription.
We can get the last emitted value of the behaviorSubject via getValue() method without needing to subscribe.
Because behaviorSubject is a class thus we have to instantiate it and we can't use it as operator.
