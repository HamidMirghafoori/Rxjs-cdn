<b>timeInterval</b>
The RxJS timeInterval() operator is used to create an Observable that emits a sequence of numbers at a constant time timeInterval. The first emission is 0, and it increments by 1 on each subsequent emission. Itâ€™s commonly used for tasks like polling, animations, or updating a UI at regular timeIntervals.
Note that if the source does not emit immediately, timeInterval will calculate the passed time since subscription time.

<i>Syntax:</i>
timeInterval(): {value, interval}
value: The original value emitted from source
interval: The time passed since last emission.
