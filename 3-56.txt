<b>single</b>
The single() operator in RxJS is used to emit a single value from an observable that meets a specific condition. If the observable emits more than one value, or if it completes without emitting any values that satisfy the condition, it will throw an error. This operator is particularly useful when you expect an observable to emit at most one value.

<i>Syntax:</i>
single(predicate?: (value, index, source) => boolean): observable
predicate: An optional function called with each item to test for condition matching
index: predicate function receive an optional index of current value for internal calculation if needed
source: The source parameter refers to the original observable (or source observable) that is emitting the values. When using a predicate function in the first operator, the third argument in the predicate provides access to this original observable, allowing you to inspect or interact with the observable within the predicate function.
