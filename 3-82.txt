<b>iif</b>
The iif operator in RxJS is a creation operator that allows you to conditionally create an observable based on a boolean expression. It enables you to decide at runtime which observable to subscribe to, making it a powerful tool for handling scenarios where the source observable may vary depending on a condition.

<i>Syntax:</i>
iif(condition: () => boolean, trueResult, falseResult): observable
condition: Condition which Observable should be chosen.
trueResult: An Observable that will be subscribed if condition is true.
falseResult: An Observable that will be subscribed if condition is false.
