<b>repeat</b>
The repeat() operator in RxJS is used to re-subscribe to an observable and re-emit its values a specified number of times, or indefinitely if no count is provided. It essentially "repeats" the observable sequence upon completion.

<i>Syntax:</i>
repeat(countOrConfig): observable
countOrConfig: Either it can be a number to specify how many times the repeat should happen (default infinity), 
or a config object with following attributes:
count: number of repeat
delay: which can be number to apply delay in milliseconds, or a function that return an observable to notify the delay time to repeat
