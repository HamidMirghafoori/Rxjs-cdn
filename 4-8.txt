<b>generate</b>
The generate operator in RxJS is a powerful utility that allows you to create an observable that emits a sequence of values based on a specified logic. It is particularly useful for generating sequences of numbers or custom objects with specific rules.
generate allows you to create a stream of values generated with a loop very similar to a traditional for loop.

<i>Syntax:</i>
generate({initialState, condition, iterate, resultSelector}): observable
initialState: The initial value from which the generation starts.
condition: A function that takes the current state and returns a boolean indicating whether to continue generating values.
iterate: A function that defines how to update the state after each emission. This function is called if the condition is true.
resultSelector (optional): A function that transforms the state into the emitted value. If not provided, the state itself is emitted.
