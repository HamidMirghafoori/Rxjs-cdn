<b>switchScan</b>
The switchScan operator in RxJS is similar to scan but with a key difference: it switches to a new inner observable and cancels the previous one whenever a new value is emitted by the source observable.
switchScan will discard the accumulator function result if the new emitted value occur before accumulator function return value.

<i>Syntax:</i>
switchScan(accumulator: (acc, value, index) => Observable, seed, concurrent = infinity): OperatorFunction
accumulator is the argument we pass to reduce operator, it is an accumulator function with following arguments: 
- acc:  the current accumulated value
- value: value emitted by the source observable in the current iteration
- index: The index represents the position of the emitted value in the sequence
seed: the initial value of accumulated value, by default it is undefined
