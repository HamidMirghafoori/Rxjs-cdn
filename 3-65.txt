<b>raceWith</b>
The raceWith() operator in RxJS is used to race multiple observables, emitting values from only the observable that emits a value first. Once one of the observables starts emitting, the other observables are ignored, and all subsequent values come from that "winning" observable.

<i>Syntax:</i>
raceWith(...observables): Observable
