<b>startWith</b>
The startWith operator, at the moment of subscription will synchronously emit the value provided for it and then subscribes to the source and it will mirror all of source emissions.
In simple word, startWith will start the observable emission with the given value at subscription time. 

In our project the clock would appear after 1 second, because it needs to wait for the first emission of interval. Using startWith will start emission immediately so we will have clock from the time the component is rendered.
