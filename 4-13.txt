<b>expand</b>
The expand operator in RxJS is used to recursively apply a projection function to the values emitted by an observable. It works like a combination of mergeMap and recursion, allowing you to generate an observable that can emit more values based on previously emitted ones


<i>Syntax:</i>
expand(project: (value, index) => Observable, concurrent?): Observable
project: This is the core function that determines how each value emitted by the source observable is transformed into a new observable
value: The current value emitted by the source observable
index: The zero-based index of the emitted value, which allows you to track how many values have been processed
concurrent?: This optional parameter controls the number of concurrent subscriptions that expand can have at any given time. It limits how many new observables (created by the project function) can be subscribed to simultaneously
