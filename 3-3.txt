<b>catchError - cont.</b>
We already know how catchError works, but catchError callback function has two arguments. We already discussed the first argument which is the error object.
The second argument is the observable that threw the error, It's the source observable that encountered the error.
By returning the caught observable basically we are telling the observable to retry itself indefinitely unless we encounter other errors or the observable completes.


Checkout to the question commit of catchError2 branch, follow instructions written for catchError2 function.
