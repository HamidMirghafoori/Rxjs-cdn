<b>timer</b>
The timer operator in RxJS is used to create an observable that emits a value after a specified delay and, optionally, continues emitting values at a specified interval.
So we can have only one delay or if we want more than one the rest will be based on given duration.

In our project we just wanted to see if we can have the same result as delay operator using timer.
And after that we will deal with the minor issue we have. After clicking the stock we have to wait 2 seconds to see the first price
We will fix it so we can see the first price immediately.
