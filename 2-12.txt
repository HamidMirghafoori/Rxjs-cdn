<b>combineLatest</b>
Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables
So, combineLatest lets you keep track of the latest values from multiple sources and emit them together in real-time

Our server has two endpoints for list of stocks, we already used the first one and the second one is called: stocks-price-part2
Now we want to display all stocks together under one list. 
To merge these two endpoints we need to use combineLatest which will waits both of api observables complete and then with the logic we provide combine both data as one observable.
There is a small issue with our output, the first api always returns two stocks from list 2 attached at the end of its list, for now we have to remove them manually.
