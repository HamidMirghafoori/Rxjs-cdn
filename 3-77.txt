<b>delayWhen</b>
The delayWhen() operator in RxJS is used to delay the emission of items from the source Observable based on a provided "delay duration" Observable. This delay duration is determined dynamically for each value emitted from the source.

<i>Syntax:</i>
delayWhen(delayDurationSelector: (value, index) => Observable): OperatorFunction
delayDurationSelector: A function that takes each value from the source Observable (and optionally its index) and returns an Observable. The source value will be emitted after this returned Observable completes.
