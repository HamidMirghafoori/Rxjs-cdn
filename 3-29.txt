<b>takeUntil</b>
The takeUntil operator in RxJS is a powerful tool used to control the lifetime of an observable. It allows you to emit values from the source observable until a notifier observable emits a value. Once the notifier emits, the source observable completes, and no further emissions are sent.
This operator is particularly useful in managing subscriptions and ensuring that observables do not continue to emit values when they are no longer needed.

<i>Syntax:</i>
takeUntil(notifier: observableInput)
Emits the values emitted by the source Observable until a notifier Observable emits a value.
