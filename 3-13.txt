<b>AsyncSubject</b>
AsyncSubject is a special type of subject in RxJS that emits the last value it has received to all of its observers when it completes. It's different from other types of subjects in that it only stores the last value and only sends that value upon completion. If the subject doesn't complete, it doesn't emit anything to its subscribers.
Because AsyncSubject is a class thus we have to instantiate it and we can't use it as operator.
