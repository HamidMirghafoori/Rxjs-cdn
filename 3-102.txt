<b>switchMap</b>
The switchMap() operator in RxJS is a higher-order mapping operator that transforms each value emitted by an observable into a new observable. It "switches" to the latest observable emitted by the mapping function, unsubscribing from any previous one.

<i>Syntax:</i>
switchMap(project: (value, index) => any, resultSelector?: (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) => any): any
project: This is a function that takes two parameters: the emitted value from the source Observable and its index. 
resultSelector: This argument is a function that combines the emitted values from both the source and the inner Observable. If provided, this function will take four parameters:
-outerValue: The value emitted by the source Observable.
-innerValue: The value emitted by the inner Observable.
-outerIndex: The index of the emitted value from the source Observable.
-innerIndex: The index of the emitted value from the inner Observable.
