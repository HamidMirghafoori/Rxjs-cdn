<b>max</b>
The RxJS max() operator is used to find the maximum value emitted by an Observable. It operates on a source Observable that emits multiple values, compares those values, and emits only the largest one when the source completes.

<i>Syntax:</i>
max(comparer?: (x,y)=> number): observable
comparer: Optional comparer function that it will use instead of its default to compare the value of two items.
