Chapter 3 is called intermediate because we are going to move toward operators that are used less frequently that the beginner chapter.
We will try to explore deeper in their functionalities and you need to put more effort on writing more complex codes.

In general the method is still the same, first the definition and explanation of the operator, then we checkout the the question commit and follow instructions to achieve requested result.
We are still working on our project code base but the focus is not on adding more functionality or ideas to the stock application.
We will start with blank page with all Angular components provided and instructions as comments.
