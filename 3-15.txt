<b>combineLatestAll</b>
combineLatestAll is an operator in RxJS that helps combine the latest values emitted by multiple inner observables. It's useful when you're working with a higher-order observable (an observable that emits observables). Specifically, it subscribes to all inner observables, waits for each one to emit at least once, and then emits an array containing the latest values from all the inner observables.
Note that all three operators combineLatest, combineLatestAll, and combineLatestWith are used when the latest value of the observables are what we need
