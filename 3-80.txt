<b>NEVER</b>
The RxJS NEVER operator creates an observable that never emits any values and never completes. It's essentially an observable that remains idle and does not produce any output.
When to use NEVER:
Cancel an operation: It can be used when you want to create an observable that effectively stops a chain of events without unsubscribing or causing errors.
Mocking or stubbing: It is often used in testing or simulations where you want an observable that will not emit or complete.

<i>Syntax:</i>
NEVER()
