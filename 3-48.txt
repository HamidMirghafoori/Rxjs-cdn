<b>sampleTime</b>
The sampleTime operator in RxJS emits the latest value from an observable at specified time intervals. It works by "sampling" the source observable periodically, and if thereâ€™s a value emitted by the source during the sampling period, sampleTime emits that value. If there are no values emitted during that interval, it skips the emission for that period

<i>Syntax:</i>
sampleTime(period): observable
period: The sampling period expressed in milliseconds
