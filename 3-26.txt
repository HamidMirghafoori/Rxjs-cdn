<b>windowWhen</b>
The windowWhen operator in RxJS is used to collect emitted values from a source observable into window observables. A new window is emitted each time a second observable (called a closing notifier) emits a value or completes, signaling the completion of the current window and the start of a new one. This operator is useful when you want to collect and group values over a variable period, determined by another observable.
