<b>delay</b>
The delay operator in RxJS is used to postpone the emission of values from an observable by a specified amount of time.
It is equivalent of javascript setTimeout function. 

To have some time to view each real time value we need to add delay between each emission. 
But we still have a minor issue, which we will fix that in next lesson. 
Before that we like to get the same result using another rxjs operator instead of delay.
