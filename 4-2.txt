<b>firstValueFrom</b>
The firstValueFrom() function in RxJS is a utility that converts an observable into a Promise and resolves with the first emitted value. It's commonly used when you need to get a single value from an observable stream and are working in an asynchronous context that supports promises (such as async/await).
 If the observable completes without emitting a value, the Promise will be rejected with an EmptyError.

<i>Syntax:</i>
firstValueFrom(observable, {defaultValue?}): Promise
defaultValue: (optional) This property allows you to provide a fallback value in case the observable completes without emitting any value. If no value is emitted and no defaultValue is provided, the Promise will be rejected with an EmptyError.
