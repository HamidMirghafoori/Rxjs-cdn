<b>ignoreElements</b>
The RxJS ignoreElements() operator is used to ignore all emitted values from the source Observable but allows its termination notifications, such as complete or error, to pass through.
ignoreElements() is useful when you are only interested in knowing if an Observable completes or errors out, and you donâ€™t care about the actual emitted data.

<i>Syntax:</i>
