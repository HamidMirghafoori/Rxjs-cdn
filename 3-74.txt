<b>map</b>
The map() operator in RxJS is a transformation operator used to modify or transform the emitted values of an Observable by applying a given function to each value before passing it along. It works similarly to the map() function in arrays but applies to the values emitted by Observables.

<i>Syntax:</i>
map(project: (value, index?) => NewValue): observable
project: A function that receive value and returns newValue after transformation
index: (optional) The current value index for internal use
