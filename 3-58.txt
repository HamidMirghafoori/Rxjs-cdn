<b>find</b>
The RxJS find() operator is used to search for the first item in an observable sequence that satisfies a given condition or predicate function. It emits the first value that meets the condition and completes. If no value satisfies the condition, it emits undefined and completes.

<i>Syntax:</i>
find(predicate: (value, index, source?)=> boolean): observable
predicate: A function called with each item to test for condition matching
value: The current value being processed in the observable.
index: predicate function receive an index of current value
source: The source parameter refers to the original observable (or source observable) that is emitting the values. When using a predicate function in the first operator, the third argument in the predicate provides access to this original observable, allowing you to inspect or interact with the observable within the predicate function.
