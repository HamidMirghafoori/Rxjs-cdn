<b>filter</b>
The filter operator in RxJS is used to filter emissions from an observable stream based on a provided condition. It allows only those items from the source observable to pass through that satisfy the condition (a predicate function).
Even though the filter logic is similar to Javascript Array.filter, however, 
it may become confusing because observables can emit array of data, 
the filter will pass or rejects the whole array in this scenario.
If you planning to filter some items from emitted array data, filter will not work here. 
We need to use Javascript Array.filter() function instead. 

In our project to demonstrate the filter operator, we chose to display a list of stock sectors. Based on the selected sector, we show the information of a clicked stock, but only if the stock's sector matches the selected one.
