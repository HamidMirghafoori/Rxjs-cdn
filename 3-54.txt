<b>first</b>
The count operator in RxJS is used to count the number of emissions made by an observable before it completes. It works by tracking how many values have been emitted by the source observable and emits the final count as a single value when the source completes.

<i>Syntax:</i>
first(predicate?: (value, index, source) => boolean, defaultValue?): observable
predicate: An optional function called with each item to test for condition matching
index: predicate function receive an optional index of current value for internal calculation if needed
source: The source parameter refers to the original observable (or source observable) that is emitting the values. When using a predicate function in the first operator, the third argument in the predicate provides access to this original observable, allowing you to inspect or interact with the observable within the predicate function.

defaultValue: The default value emitted in case no valid value was found on the source
