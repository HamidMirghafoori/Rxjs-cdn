<b>distinctUntilKeyChanged</b>
The distinctUntilKeyChanged operator in RxJS is used to filter out consecutive repeated values based on a specific key in objects emitted by an observable. It ensures that only distinct values are passed downstream when the specified key's value changes between successive emissions.
Note distinctUntilKeyChanged is specific version of distinctUntilChanged, which only works on objects and one key.

<i>Syntax:</i>
distinctUntilKeyChanged(key, comparator?: (previous, current) => boolean): observable
key: the key in the object will be used for comparison
comparator: Optional function that performs custom comparison, it receives previous and current value to be compared
