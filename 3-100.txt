<b>mergeAll</b>
The mergeAll() operator in RxJS is used to flatten higher-order observables, which are observables that emit other observables. When you have an observable that emits multiple inner observables over time, mergeAll() can be used to combine those emissions into a single observable stream.

<i>Syntax:</i>
mergeAll(concurrent?: number = Infinity): any
concurrent: (optional) This parameter controls the maximum number of inner Observables that can be subscribed to simultaneously. By default, it is set to Infinity.
