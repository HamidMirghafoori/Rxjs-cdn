<b>of</b>
The <i>of</i> operator creates an observable that emits the provided arguments as a sequence and then completes immediately.

In our project, we aim to display a list of stocks along with their prices by defining a component called <i>StocksPricesComponent</i>.
The observable <i>stockPrices$</i> is declared using of operator and utilized within the template. 
The "of" operator generates an observable that returns the entire array synchronously, meaning each item passed to it must complete before the next one is processed.
Currently, we are passing hardcoded values to the of operator, but these will eventually be replaced with data from an HTTP API call.
We should use the <i>async</i> pipe  to manage subscriptions automatically, eliminating the need for manual unsubscription.
