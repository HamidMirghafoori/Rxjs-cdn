RxJS, short for Reactive Extensions for JavaScript, is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using Observables. It offers a powerful set of operators that help handle various types of asynchronous operations such as user inputs, server requests, real-time data streams, and more, in a declarative manner. RxJS enables developers to handle complex data flows in a clean, readable, and efficient way.
