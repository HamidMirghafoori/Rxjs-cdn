<b>fromEvent</b>
The fromEvent() operator in RxJS creates an observable that emits values based on events from a DOM element or other event target. It's commonly used to capture events like clicks, keypresses, scrolls, or other DOM-related events, transforming them into observable streams that you can then manipulate with RxJS operators.

<i>Syntax:</i>
fromEvent(target, eventName, options?: () => value, resultSelector?): observable
target: The DOM EventTarget, Node.js EventEmitter, JQuery-like event target, NodeList or HTMLCollection to attach the event handler to.
eventName: The event name of interest, being emitted by the target.
options: Optional. Options to pass through to the underlying addListener, addEventListener or on functions.
resultSelector: A mapping function used to transform events. It takes the arguments from the event handler and should return a single value.
