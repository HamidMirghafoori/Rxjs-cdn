The observable a$ will emit the value 10 each time an observer subscribes to it. Since it is simply returning a fixed integer, it will never emit an error. After emitting the value 10, it will call complete() to signal to the observer that the data stream is finished and no further values will be emitted.
so if observer just console.log(value), we will see number 10 is printed in console.

On the other hand, b$ will behave the same, but instead of returning whole array, it will return each item separately till it reaches to the end of the array and emit complete() method.
In this case if the observer logs the value we will have 5 logs in the console as following:
1
2
3
4
5
even though values are emitted right after each other, but they are separate values and they are not emitted at the exact same time. Si the observer will deal with values each at a time.
