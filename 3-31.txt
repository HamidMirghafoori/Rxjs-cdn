<b>groupBy</b>
The groupBy operator in RxJS is used to group emitted values from an observable into separate observables, each of which corresponds to a unique key. It acts similarly to how SQL's GROUP BY works, except that instead of creating aggregated values, it creates individual grouped observables.

<i>Syntax:</i>
groupBy(keySelector: Fn, {element?: (value)=>value, duration?: (grouped)=> Observable})
keySelector: A function that extracts a key from each emitted value. The groupBy operator uses this key to group values.
element: A function that extracts the return element for each item. 
duration: A function that returns an Observable to determine how long each group should exist.
