<b>tap</b>
The tap operator in RxJS is used for side effects in an observable chain without modifying the emitted values. It's often used for logging, debugging, or performing actions based on the emitted values without affecting the data flow.

In our project we decided instead of creating new observables for minRange and maxRange, we use simple attributes and updated them using tap() operator.
