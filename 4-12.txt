<b>using</b>
The using operator in RxJS creates an observable that depends on a resource, typically a resource that needs to be disposed of after the observable completes or errors. It ensures that the resource is properly cleaned up when the observable lifecycle is over.
The using operator is useful when working with external resources (like file handles, subscriptions, or connections) that need to be explicitly released once the observable completes, errors, or is unsubscribed.

<i>Syntax:</i>
using(resourceFactory: () => { unsubscribe() }, observableFactory: (resource) => Observable): Observable
resourceFactory: A function that creates the resource, which must have an unsubscribe() method. This method will be called when the observable completes or errors.
observableFactory: A function that creates an observable and is passed the resource created by resourceFactory.
