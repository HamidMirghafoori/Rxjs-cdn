<b>switchAll</b>
The RxJS switchAll() operator is used to flatten higher-order observables, which means it transforms an observable that emits other observables into a single observable that emits values from the most recent inner observable.
Note if the higher order observable returns combination of multiple observables switchAll will subscribe to all of them.

<i>Syntax:</i>
switchAll(): any
