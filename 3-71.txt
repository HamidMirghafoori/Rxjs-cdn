<b>delay</b>
The delay() operator in RxJS is used to delay the emission of items from an Observable by a specified amount of time. When applied, it shifts the emissions from the source Observable forward by the provided duration.

<i>Syntax:</i>
delay(due): observable
due: The amount of delay in milliseconds (number) or a specific Date.
 If a number is provided, each emission is delayed by that time. If a Date is provided, the delay is calculated relative to the current time.
