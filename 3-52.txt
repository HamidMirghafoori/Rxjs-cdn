<b>skipWhile</b>
The skipWhile() operator in RxJS allows you to ignore (or "skip") emitted values from an observable until a certain condition is no longer met. Once the condition becomes false, it starts emitting all subsequent values, regardless of whether they would satisfy the condition.

<i>Syntax:</i>
skipWhile(predicate: (value, index?) => boolean): observable
predicate: A function to test each item emitted from the source Observable.
index: predicate function receive an optional index of current value for internal calculation if needed
