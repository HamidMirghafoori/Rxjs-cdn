<b>concatAll</b>
The concatAll() operator in RxJS is a higher-order mapping operator that flattens an observable of observables by concatenating them in order. When you have an observable that emits inner observables (also called higher-order observables), concatAll() will subscribe to the first emitted observable, wait for it to complete, and then move on to the next observable, processing them sequentially.

<i>Syntax:</i>
concatAll(): observable
