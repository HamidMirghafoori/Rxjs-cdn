<b>windowToggle</b>
The windowToggle operator in RxJS is used to split a source Observable into "windows" (sub-Observables), based on opening and closing signals from other Observables. Each "window" is an Observable itself, which emits the values from the source Observable that fall within its time frame.
Same as bufferToggle it is used for grouping values into time-limited batches based on external events (e.g., user clicks, sensor data).
And segmenting data streams for processing only within specific time frames.
The syntax of windowToggle operator:
windowToggle(openings: Observable<O>, closingSelector: (value: O) => Observable<any>)
openings can be any observable that emits a value
closingSelector is a function which will receive the value emitted by openings observable (we can use the value or ignore it) and it emits a signal in return
Note: if openings triggered and source completes windowToggle will emit buffered values from openings time till completion of source.
