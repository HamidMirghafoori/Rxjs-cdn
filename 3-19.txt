<b>bufferTime</b>
The bufferTime operator in RxJS is used to collect emitted values from an observable over a specified period of time and then emit those values as an array. This can be useful for batching data or reducing the frequency of emissions
bufferTime accepts three arguments which 2 of them are optional:
1 - bufferTimeSpan: The duration (in milliseconds) for which to collect emitted values before emitting them as an array. After this duration, the collected values are emitted as a single array.
2 - bufferCreationInterval: (optional): If provided, it specifies the interval at which a new buffer should be created. Instead of waiting for the first buffer to fill up, a new buffer will be started every bufferCreationInterval.
Note if we provide arguments like this: (600, 1200) the first buffer will collect emits from 0-600 and 2nd buffer will be open from 1200-1800 and 3rd will be open from 2400-3000 etc.
3 - maxBufferSize:  (optional): The maximum number of values that the buffer can hold. If the number of emitted values exceeds this size, older values will be discarded.
Adding maxBufferSize limits the bufferCreationInterval results to given number.
