<b>range</b>
The RxJS range() operator creates an Observable that emits a sequence of numbers within a specified range and then completes. It is useful when you need a sequence of numbers for things like loops, counters, or simple range-related operations in RxJS streams.

<i>Syntax:</i>
range(start, count): Observable
start: starting value
count: total number of sequential numbers to emit
