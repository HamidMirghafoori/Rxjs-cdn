<b>replaySubject</b>
The ReplaySubject is a special kind of Subject in RxJS that allows you to cache and replay a specific number of emitted values (or all values) to new subscribers. It behaves like a normal Subject in that it can be subscribed to and emit values, but with the added ability to buffer and replay a certain number of previous values.
Because replaySubject is a class thus we have to instantiate it and we can't use it as operator.
