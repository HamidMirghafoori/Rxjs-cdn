<b>fromEvent</b>
The fromEvent operator in RxJS is used to create an observable from an event on a DOM element or an event emitter. It allows you to listen for events (like clicks, key presses, mouse movements, etc.) and convert them into a stream of values that can be processed with RxJS operators.


In our project instead of using a function to handle click event of our button, we decided to use fromEvent operator so we can have better understanding on how it works.
The idea is that we have an observable that every 8 seconds calls and endpoint to fetch the latest price of the stock, and we added a button to fetch the latest price right away.
