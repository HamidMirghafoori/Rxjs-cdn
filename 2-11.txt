<b>forkJoin</b>
forkJoin is an RxJS operator that allows you to execute multiple observables in parallel and wait for all of them to complete before emitting a single value. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you have multiple asynchronous operations and you want to perform some action only after all of them have completed.
Basically:
- forkJoin takes an array of observables and subscribes to all of them concurrently.
-  It waits for all observables to complete before emitting a single array of the last emitted values from each observable.
