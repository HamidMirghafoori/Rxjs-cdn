<b>sample</b>
The RxJS sample() operator emits the most recent value from the source observable whenever another observable (the "notifier" observable) emits a value. This means that it "samples" the source observable based on the timing of the notifier observable's emissions. If the source observable hasn't emitted a value since the last sampling, sample() will skip that emission.

<i>Syntax:</i>
sample(notifier):  observable
notifier: The ObservableInput to use for sampling the source Observable
