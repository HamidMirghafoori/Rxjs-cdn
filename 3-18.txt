<b>bufferCount</b>
The bufferCount() operator in RxJS collects emitted values from an observable into arrays (buffers) and emits those arrays once the buffer reaches a specified size. This operator is useful when you want to group a certain number of values before processing them.
bufferCount accepts to parameter, the first one is the size of buffer, the 2nd one is optional and called startBufferEvery.
startBufferEvery determines how often to start a new buffer. If not provided, the buffers are created back-to-back. If specified, it starts a new buffer after the specified number of emissions.
for example buffer(5,3) means we need buffers of 5 elements and after every 3 emits the next buffer should start. 
This way we can have overlapping windows or gaps over the emitted values.
