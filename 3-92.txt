<b>distinct</b>
The distinct() operator in RxJS is used to filter out repeated values from an observable sequence based on strict equality. It only emits unique values, meaning once a value has been emitted, any subsequent emissions of the same value will be ignored.

<i>Syntax:</i>
distinct(keySelector?: (value) => value, flushes?: observable): observable
keySelector: Optional function to select which value you want to check as distinct.
flushes: Optional ObservableInput for flushing the internal HashSet of the operator.
