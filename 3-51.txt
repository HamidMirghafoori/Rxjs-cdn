<b>skipUntil</b>
The RxJS skipLast() operator is used to filter out a specified number of values from the end of an observable stream. In other words, it skips the last n emitted values, where n is the argument passed to the operator.
Before the notifier emits, all values from the source are ignored.

<i>Syntax:</i>
skipUntil(notifier): observable
notifier: The Observable that triggers the start of emission.
